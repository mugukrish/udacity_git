How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It was very helpful and easy when the text file was very large.
The thing is it since the comparison is made with the changed lines from both files we
can find the bug easily.

-----------------------------------------

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Having a backup of the changes made can help in rectifying a error in the further 
Updates of the file. If the new version is throwing a error, you can always use 
the old one to find out the bugs.

-------------------------------------------

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


Pros:
	we can choose when the file must be saved
	reduce the size unwanted versions present
	
Cons:
	we humans tend to forget to save sometimes
	small changes may not be recorded
	proper saving habits must be followed

------------------------------------------

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Ween it comes to programming, some files may be linked with others.
Only if multiple files are committed the bugs can be easily identified.

--------------------------------------------

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log can be used to find the history of commits made. Each commit will have an Id.
Using those id's we can use git diff id1 id2 and find out the changes made.

---------------------------------------------


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It is very easy to restore commits made so we have more flexibility.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I can use it to work on new projects.
